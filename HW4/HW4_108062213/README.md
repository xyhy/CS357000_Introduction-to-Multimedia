### Problem 1
### Discription
>It read an image and point.txt file. The point.txt file contains the coordinates of the all points need to be draw on the image. The program will use the coordinates to calculate the curve and draw on the image. And the program also can do 4 times upscaled by nearest-neighbor algorithm. The output images are saved in the './output/' directory.
### Requirements
> 1. python3 == 3.7.15
> 2. numpy == 1.21.6
> 3. opencv-python == 4.6.0.66

### Usage
>python3 1.py
### Notes
>The input file should be in png format and txt format.
>The output images will be saved in PNG format.
